# Population-Inversion-for-Argon-Laser-Atomic-System
This is a program that provides a graphical solution for the population inversion of the levels 2 and 3 of the Argon laser atomic system. It is a 4-level system where the transition of the atoms between levels 2 and 3 is important for receiving the emission in blue and green regions of the electromagnetic spectrum (488 nm and 514.5 nm).
